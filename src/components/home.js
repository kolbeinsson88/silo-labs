                            Leadership allows us to create complex organizations, maintain control within organizations while providing us with a beneficial sense of direction. It provides an effective administration, allowing actors such as businesses and organizations to return measurable results, like science and production. It has the ability to put plans into action while making sure they are completed.

                            Consumption will decrease in public areas such as art galleries, libraries, television, Internet, places of worship, parks, roads and streets and so on. Modify consumption in the selected areas, thus modifying daily activities of the exposed individuals. Also place coded tags on books in library management systems then remove selected works, leaving only pertinent information.

                        <p>
                            Update government websites, therefore effectively censoring all unwanted content to match government schematics: Empower workers rights, democratization of corporations and public ownership. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Allow Dataism as a school of thought. Install computers in government institutions so they can register key information and statistics using computer systems while preventing corruption of datasets and databases. Support software development when it results in greater distribution of digital information. Remove laws that criminalize the distribution of digital information. Accept era of pornography and remove laws that criminalize the distribution of sexual content.

                            Adopt technocracy then solve social problems with the use of modern technologies. Further improve electronic administration by moving public services online - one place if possible. Encourage business productivity and increase profits with the use of automation and digital computing. Online business transactions will take place online thanks to e-commerce. Invest in smart technologies if they improve business and institutional efficiency. Further improve internet connectivity, since the Internet of Things (IoT) could not continue without the Internet.

                            Argue labor theory of value, where the measured time of quantifiable labor serves as the basis of economic evaluation for goods and services. Exception is granted if the object in question has artistic or sentimental value. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Create an elite class of intellectuals, politicians and magnates. Otherwise it is impossible to set national guidelines and the result is an unruly economic and political climate where individuals can make random political calculations. Elite selection is based on merit and espoused views. Best way to confirm selections is by inspecting views, previous works and education. Elites will need government employment, research grants and project grants in exchange for their services.

                            Make policy changes in order to achieve scientific progress. Higher percentage of GDP is spent on research and development. University graduates can apply for research and project grants rather than unemployment benefits. Grants are sufficient to protect class interest. Check submitted works to rate scientists, researchers and universities. Best works are used to further state interest.

                            The state will allocate capital to take over Icelandic banks in order to establish a state bank. The state will intervene to protect economic interests.

                        <p>
                            Lunch government programs in order to cultivate wastelands and improve soil.

                        <p>
                            Use state funds to create state monopoly by purchasing systemically important business sectors. Identify and buy quality businesses and use legislation to bolster their profits. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Create a state campaign for job evaluations. State employees will present their project plan for the previous years and be judged on those basis. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Put emphasis on automation and standardization. We want to use computer systems, for instance, in hospitals to calculate certain outcomes like mortality rate, administration of drugs, treatments, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Encourage mechanization on a large scale. There is a connection between mechanization and industrial output. Large machinery is too expensive for most Icelandic industries. We would like to change this using rentals for large scale machinery. Rent is charged by the hour. Hopefully, this will give industrialists an advantage.

                            Rights of inheritance are abolished.

                            The Education Agency (Menntam√°lastofnun) will collect educational material and create a software solution that allows educators to teach remotely and locally. Education is subsidized by the state. Education is legally required by the state until age 13, after that education can be neglected.

                            Art students are allowed to participate in major construction projects. Projects will receive better appraisals thanks to their various designs. Their artwork will also be appreciated.

                            State funds are allocated towards the creation of several server farms. The state will have greater computing power. The state will host the greatest number of web servers and applications. It will host computer code owned by the state and private individuals. The farm will have a cloud in order to store research and documents. For security reasons, data will be stored at several state farms.
