                            Leadership allows us to create complex organizations, maintain control within organizations while providing us with a beneficial sense of direction. It provides an effective administration, allowing actors such as businesses and organizations to return measurable results, like science and production. It has the ability to put plans into action while making sure they are completed.

                            Consumption will decrease in public areas such as art galleries, libraries, television, Internet, places of worship, parks, roads and streets and so on. Modify consumption in the selected areas, thus modifying daily activities of the exposed individuals. Also place coded tags on books in library management systems then remove selected works, leaving only pertinent information.

                            Update government websites, therefore effectively censoring all unwanted content to match government schematics: Empower workers rights, democratization of corporations and public ownership.

                        <p>
                            Allow dataism as a school of thought. Install computers in government institutions so they can register key information and statistics using computer systems or software. Prevent corruption of datasets and databases. Encourage software development and the services they offer while attempting to manipulate all online data streams. 
                        </p>

                            Adopt technocracy then solve social problems with the use of modern technologies. Further improve electronic administration by moving public services online - one place if possible. Encourage business productivity and increase profits with the use of automation and digital computing. Online business transactions will take place online thanks to e-commerce. Invest in smart technologies if they improve business and institutional efficiency. Further improve internet connectivity, since the Internet of Things (IoT) could not continue without the Internet.

                            Argue labor theory of value, where the measured time of quantifiable labor serves as the basis of economic evaluation for goods and services. Exception is granted if the object in question has artistic or sentimental value.

                            Create an elite class of intellectuals, politicians and magnates. Otherwise it is impossible to set national guidelines and the result is an unruly economic and political climate where individuals can make random political calculations. Elite selection is based on merit and espoused views. Best way to confirm selections is by inspecting views, previous works and education. Elites will need government employment, research grants and project grants in exchange for their services.

                            Make policy changes in order to achieve scientific progress. Higher percentage of GDP is spent on research and development. University graduates can apply for research and project grants rather than unemployment benefits. Grants are sufficient to protect class interest. Check submitted works to rate scientists, researchers and universities. Best works are used to further state interest.

                            The state will allocate capital to take over Icelandic banks in order to establish a state bank. The state will intervene to protect economic interests.
