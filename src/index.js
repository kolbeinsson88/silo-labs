    <!-- SILO LAB DIAGNOSTICS
      Searching for domestic abuses. Place contacts for current court justices into a 
      book. 

      Growing hole in our employment market for a selected group of individuals. 

      If the government is unable to work in a particular sector such as tech or engineering, 
      they should allow other people to work there, rather than shift industrial priorities to 
      better suit them. 

      Continue working! Output must not be replaced by "lazy loading"! Communications, transportations 
      and remote work are the usual suspects. Labor would like to quit working.

      We are not harnessing labor to create highly valuable items competing on a real market. Our 
      currency is pegged to that.

      Large amounts of global manufacturing is trash that needs to be sold on the market, in order 
      to save the businesses involved. Goods and services are likely trashed. Thats your export. 

      Check AI, if all market goods are unpriced, i.e. no rational price for market goods.

      Embrace subjective theory of value as the basis of object valuations. Recognize other 
      theories such as exchange theory of value and calculation in-natura for its use value - money 
      distorts that truth and leaves you without any valuation of goods. 

      In the end, the price for goods and services is whatever you are willing to pay.

      End administrative errors! Half-baked monologues are entering into government causing a system 
      wide glitch followed by more errors. 

      Build communist elites. 

      End activities on social media. 

      End work related gatherings with other members of administration, such as courses, conferences, 
      meetings with other members of administration - delegate those tasks to subtypes while returning 
      "local storage" to the factory. 

      Create a new administration. Independently managed, with isolated and modulated parts. Where each 
      part is a kingdom answering to very few.

      We should work (government, army, state and so on) and return common productivity of lesser yield, 
      front followed by hidden produce. It should be placed into "local storage" factories and brought 
      into current or future markets thanks to state ownership.

      Check math? Its the backbone in technical sciences and in sectors or industries. Not to mention scientific 
      Marxism and planning. 

      Math? Its like asking "What is biology, chemistry, money, ships, buildings, statistical analytics and so on?".

      Mode of production is not returning a stable profit based on market analysis. Keep an eye on the 
      accumulation of "lazy loaders" and "blue screens of death" eating up wages while returning 
      productivity of lesser quality. 

      Control organizations. Put info on this in order to convert to Marxism. Drop everything else.

      Check arguments of admission. Proper arguments, proper understanding and an ideological commitment. 

      Check the administration's beliefs.  

      Verify commitment. There can be no continuous "leap forward" without proper ideological fervor. 

      Finally, we can no longer pull out the red carpet for the "man of the hour", allowing him to meddle 
      with the inner workings of state. Resignations are written by a few selected individuals.

      Also seeing style over substance, even in government. This is not someone you can have a serious 
      conversation with. 

      True government is the last of a generation. Unable to care if state actors represent what some are 
      now calling “ideological chatter”. Our position is deceptively weak thanks to the way this country is 
      governed.

      We dont believe elites should be defeated or overthrown, we prefer they admit their own folly then 
      allow other parties to take over.

    <!-- BLACKLIST
      Its not revenge but rather punishment:
      - Blacklisted in Asia: Assign "army errors" and "state errors" to Asia for "bukkake". They may resign.
      - Blacklisted in Asia: Assign "selected criminals" to Asia and report crime.
      - Blacklisted domestically: Write new laws for the employment market followed by an online service that 
      will process all job applications. Remove unsuitable applications. 
      -->

    <!--END GAME
      Create electronic administration, then create a government team who has complete access to all codebase 
      pertinent to administration, in order to usher in a new era - digitalization is also encouraged in economics.
      
      Once a new era is achieved, check the contents of the "local storage" factory and promote elitism. Markets will 
      use domestic solutions "is". Use trusted solutions and force strict discipline: Check government contracts, state 
      banking, slash government funding etc.
